* TODO cursors?
  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Because relational databases are oriented toward sets, no concept of
  next row exists, meaning that you cannot operate on an individual
  row in a set. Cursor functionality solves this problem by letting a
  result set be processed one row at a time, similar to the way you
  read and update a file on a disk. A DB-Library cursor indicates the
  current position in a result set, just as the cursor on your screen
  indicates the current position in a block of text.

* dblib
  Client-Library is a library designed to accommodate cursors and
  other advanced features. [as opposed to DB-Library, etc.]

  dbfcmd – adds text to the command buffer using sprintf-type
  formatting. This routine is the same as dbcmd, except that it allows
  arguments to be substituted into the text. [but does it do escaping?]

  There are two types of result rows: regular rows and compute
  rows. Regular rows are generated from columns in a select command’s
  select list; compute rows are generated from columns in a select
  command’s compute clause. Since these two types of rows contain very
  different data, the application must process them separately.

  If a command batch contains only a single Transact-SQL command and
  that command does not return rows (for example, a use database
  command or an insert command), an application does not have to call
  dbresults to process the results of the command. However, calling
  dbresults in these situations causes no harm. It may result in
  easier code maintenance if, after every command, you consistently
  call dbresults until it returns NO_MORE_RESULTS.

  If the command batch contains more than one Transact-SQL command, an
  application must call dbresults once for every command in the batch,
  whether or not the command returns rows. For this reason, it is
  recommended that a DB- Library/C application always call dbresults
  in a loop after sending a command or commands to a server.

** binding
   [here's where the binding comes in (with escaping, i hope):]

   The simplest way to get result data is to bind result columns to
   program variables, using dbbind and dbaltbind. Then, when the
   application calls dbnextrow to read a result row (see “Reading
   result rows” on page 19), DB- Library/C will automatically place
   copies of the columns’ data into the program variables to which they
   are bound. The application must call dbbind and dbaltbind after a
   dbresults call but before the first call to dbnextrow.

** buffer
   [to reiterate the command buffer (why: transactions?):]

   Note that DB-Library/C processes results one command at a time. When
   the application has read all the results for one command, it must
   call dbresults again to set up the results for the next command in
   the command buffer. To ensure that all results are handled, Sybase
   strongly recommends that dbresults be called in a loop.

** cancelling
   [cancelling (as opposed to gathering all the results à la freetds
   dblib docs):]

   The following routines cancel results:
   - dbcancel :: cancels results from the current command batch. This
                 routine cancels all the commands in the current batch.
   - dbcanquery :: cancels any rows pending from the most recently
                   executed query.

** timeouts

   By default, DB-Library will wait indefinitely for the results of a
   server command to arrive. Applications can use the routines below to
   specify a finite timeout period:
   - dbsettime :: sets the number of seconds that DB-Library/C will
                  wait for a server response
   - DBGETTIME :: gets the number of seconds that DB-Library/C will
                  wait for a server response

** buffers
   to reiterate the processing of command buffers (why: transaction?):

   Note that DB-Library/C processes results one command at a time. When
   the application has read all the results for one command, it must
   call dbresults again to set up the results for the next command in
   the command buffer. To ensure that all results are handled, Sybase
   strongly recommends that dbresults be called in a loop.

** messages vs. errors

   - Server messages and errors, which range in severity from
     informational messages to fatal errors. Server messages and errors
     are known to DB- Library/C applications as “messages.” To list all
     possible Adaptive Server messages, use the Transact-SQL command:

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     select * from sysmessages
     #+END_QUOTE

   - DB-Library/C warnings and errors, known to DB-Library/C applications
     as “errors.”

** mainline vs. centralized error-checking

   - Test DB-Library/C routine return codes in the mainline code,
     handling failures on a case-by-case basis
   - Centralize message and error handling by installing a message
     handler and an error handler, which are then automatically called
     by DB-Library/C when a message or error occurs
     
     Note, however, that even an application that uses centralized error
     and message handling will need some mainline error logic, depending
     on the nature of the application.

     To provide a DB-Library/C application with centralized message and
     error handling, the application programmer must write a message
     handler and an error handler and install them via =dbmsghandle= and
     =dberrhandle=.

** browse mode (this is cool)

   Browse mode provides a means for browsing through database rows and
   updating their values a row at a time.

** text and image types

   text and image are Adaptive Server datatypes designed to hold large
   text or image values. The text datatype will hold up to
   2,147,483,647 bytes of printable characters. The image datatype will
   hold up to 2,147,483,647 bytes of binary data.

   Because they can be so large, text and image values are not actually
   stored in database tables. Instead, a pointer to the text or image
   value is stored in the table. This pointer is called a “text
   pointer.”

** conversion

   DB-Library/C supports conversions between most server datatypes with
   the dbconvert and dbconvert_ps routines. For information on server
   datatypes, see “Types” on page 408.

   The dbbind, dbbind_ps, dbaltbind, and dbaltbind_ps routines, which
   bind result columns to program variables, can also be used to
   perform type conversion. Those routines each contain a parameter
   that specifies the datatype of the receiving program variable. If
   the data being returned from the server is of a different datatype,
   DB-Library/C will usually convert it automatically to the type
   specified by the parameter.

** process control flow

** remote procedure call

   However, a remote procedure call is often more efficient than an
   execute command. [hmm; thus.]

** datetime and money

** cleanup

** cursors

   - dbcursor :: Inserts, updates, deletes, locks, or refreshes a
                 particular row in the fetch buffer

   ah, thus.
* ctlib
** manual vs. guide
   Although there is some introductory material about application
   development in this manual, it is highly recommended that
   applications programmers read the Client-Library Programmer’s Guide
   before designing a Client-Library application.
** initialization
   ct_init initializes Client-Library. An application calls ct_init
   after calling cs_ctx_alloc and before calling any other
   Client-Library routine.
** results
   Almost all Client-Library programs will process results by using a
   loop controlled by ct_results. Inside the loop, a switch takes place
   on the current type of result. Different types of results require
   different types of processing.

   For row results, typically the number of columns in the result set
   is determined and then used to control a loop in which result items
   are bound to program variables. An application can call ct_res_info
   to get the number of result columns, but in the example this is not
   necessary, because exactly two columns were selected. After the
   result items are bound, ct_fetch is called to fetch data rows until
   end-of-data.

   ct_bind binds a result item to a program variable. Binding creates
   an association between a result item and a program data space. [so
   binding is the opposite of what i assumed: not for constructing
   commands, but for binding results to variables; or is the former
   also available?]

   ct_fetch fetches result data. In the example, since binding has been
   specified and the count field in the CS_DATAFMT structure for each
   column is set to 1, each ct_fetch call copies one row of data into
   program data space. As each row is fetched, the example program
   prints it.
** synchronicity
   Non-asynchronous routines can also return CS_BUSY if called when an
   asynchronous operation is pending for a connection. [ouch.]
** browse mode
   Browse mode is included in 10.0 Client-Library in order to provide
   compatibility with Open Server applications and older Open Client
   libraries. Its use in new Open Client Client-Library applications
   is discouraged, because cursors provide the same functionality in a
   more portable and flexible manner. Further, browse mode is
   SYBASE-specific and is not suited for use in a heterogeneous
   environment.
** callbacks
   Two types of callback events, however, can occur when
   Client-Library is not reading from the network. These are:
   - The completion callback event, which occurs when an asynchronous
     Client-Library routine completes.
   - The notification callback event, which occurs when an Open Server
     notification arrives for an application.

*** client message callbacks
    A client message callback must return either:
    - CS_SUCCEED, to instruct Client-Library to continue any processing
      that is currently occurring on this connection.
    - CS_FAIL, to instruct Client-Library to terminate any processing
      that is currently occurring on this connection.
*** completion callbacks
    A completion callback is called whenever an application receives
    notice that an asynchronous routine has completed. 
*** notification callbacks
    A registered procedure is a type of procedure that is defined and
    installed in a running Open Server. A Client-Library application
    can use a remote procedure call command to execute a registered
    procedure, and can “watch” for a registered procedure to execute.
*** server message callbacks
    An application can handle server error and informational messages
    in- line, or through a server message callback routine. 
** commands
   1. Initiate the command by calling ct_command, ct_cursor, or
      ct_dynamic.
   2. Pass parameters for the command (if required). Most applications
      pass parameters by calling ct_param once for each parameter that
      the command requires, but it is also possible to pass parameters
      for a command by using ct_dyndesc.
   3. Send the command to the server by calling ct_send.
   4. Verify the success of the command by calling ct_results.

   [sweet: parameters is what i'm talking about (i think); can you
   "bind" them? "pass"?]
*** ct_dynamic
    "prepared statements," of course; so-called "pre-compiler use"?

     - The ability to send a command to execute a prepared statement
       and reference the statement with a unique identifier.

       A prepared statement is a statement that has been compiled and
       stored with an identifier as a result of a
       ct_dynamic(CS_PREPARE) call and a ct_send call.

       An application typically prepares a statement if it plans to
       execute the statement multiple times. Variables are
       particularly useful in dynamic commands because they allow an
       application to compile a statement once and change the values
       of the statement’s variables each time it executes the
       statement.
     - The ability to describe (with CS_DESCRIBE_OUTPUT) prepared
       statement output before sending a command to execute the
       statement.
     - Less overhead and faster performance than ct_command, if the
       statement is executed more than once. This benefit is specific
       to the execution of SQL statements on a SQL Server.

     All of the above advantages can also be realized using a stored
     procedure and either language or RPC commands. [fuck that!]
** cursors
** dynamic sql
   [this is what they call "prepared statements", it seems.]

   Dynamic SQL is primarily useful for precompiler support, but it can
   also be used by interactive applications that do either of the
   following:
   - Generate SQL statements based on information provided by an
     end-user
   - Allow end-users to create whole or partial SQL statements

   By ANSI definition, a cursor is associated with a single result
   set, and thus, a single SQL statement. This means that a dynamic
   SQL prepared statement can only be either:
   - A SQL select statement or a:
   - A Transact-SQL execute statement The stored procedure being
     executed can contain only a single SQL select statement.

   [does this preclude update, delete, etc.? what the fuck is a
   transact-sql statement?]

   SQL Server implements dynamic SQL using temporary stored
   procedures. A temporary stored procedure is created when a SQL
   statement is prepared, and destroyed when that prepared statement
   is de-allocated. De-allocation can occur either explicitly with a
   ct_dynamic(CS_DEALLOC) call or implicitly when a connection is
   closed.

   See the Transact-SQL User’s Guide for a complete discussion of
   stored procedures. [ah, i see.]

   There are two ways to dynamically execute SQL statements. One is to
   perform the prepare and execute operations in one step, and the
   other is to perform the prepare and execute operations separately.

   Executing a SQL statement is what actually makes things happen:
   rows are added by an insert statement, removed by a delete
   statement, changed by an update statement, or retrieved by a select
   statement. [nice, i guess it does support that.]

*** prepare and execute
    - Prepare the dynamic SQL statement.
    - Get a description of prepared statement input, if necessary.
    - Get a description of prepared statement output, if necessary.
    - Execute the prepared statement or declare and open a cursor on the
      prepared statement.
    - Process results, if necessary.
    - De-allocate the prepared statement.
**** preparing
     1. Store the text of the statement in a character string host
        variable,
        for example:
        char        *query = “select type, title, price
                                     from titles
                                     where title_id = ?”
        The SQL statement may include one or more dynamic parameter
        markers that act as placeholders. A placeholder is represented
        by a “?” character. Placeholders can be specified:
        - For one or more columns in a select list
        - For one or more values in an insert statement
        - In the set clause of an update statement
        - In a where clause of a select or update statement
        At execution time, the application must substitute a value for
        each dynamic parameter marker.
     2. Call ct_dynamic with type as CS_PREPARE to initiate a command to
        prepare the statement.
        To initiate a command to prepare the above SQL statement:
        ct_dynamic(cmd, CS_PREPARE, “myid”, CS_NULLTERM,
              query, CS_NULLTERM);
        To initiate a command to prepare a statement that executes a
        stored procedure, specify “exec sp_name” as the SQL text, where
        sp_name is the actual name of the stored procedure to be
        executed:
        ct_dynamic(cmd, CS_PREPARE, “myid”, CS_NULLTERM,
              “exec sp_2”, CS_NULLTERM);
     3. Call ct_send to send the command to the server.
     4. Call ct_results as necessary to process the results of the command.
        A successful CS_PREPARE command will generate a
        CS_CMD_SUCCEED result.
**** executing
     1. Call ct_dynamic with type as CS_EXECUTE to initiate a command to
        execute the statement.
     2. Define the input values to the SQL statement by performing the
        following steps for each input value:
        - Prompt the end-user for an input value.
        - Call ct_param to pass the input value to the SQL statement.
        Alternately, if the application is using a dynamic SQL descriptor
        area, perform these steps for each input value:
        - Prompt the end-user for an input value.
        - Call ct_dyndesc with operation as CS_SETATT to put the value into
          the descriptor area.
        If the application is using a dynamic SQL descriptor area, then
        after all the input values have been defined, associate the
        dynamic SQL descriptor area with the prepared statement:
        - Call ct_dyndesc with operation as CS_USE_DESC.
        The input values are substituted for the dynamic parameter
        markers.
     3. Call ct_send to send the command to the server.
     4. Call ct_results as necessary to process the results of the command.
**** de-allocating
     1. If the application used descriptor areas for the prepared statement
        input and output, de-allocate the descriptor areas by calling
        dt_dyndesc with operation as CS_DEALLOC once for each descriptor
        area.
     2. Call ct_dynamic with type as CS_DEALLOC to initiate a command to
        de-allocate the prepared statement.
     3. If the application declared and opened a cursor on the prepared
        statement, call ct_cursor with type as CS_CURSOR_CLOSE and option
        as CS_DEALLOC to initiate a command both to close and de-
        allocate the cursor.
     4. Call ct_send to send the command to de-allocate the statement.
     5. Call ct_results as necessary to process the results of the command.
*** vs. stored procedures
    Because of the numerous restrictions of dynamic SQL, we recommend
    that applications use stored procedures to accomplish the same
    tasks. Stored procedures offer identical functionality to dynamic
    SQL except for the ability to get a description of prepared
    statement input: creating a stored procedure is analogous to
    preparing a SQL statement, a stored procedure’s input parameters
    serve the same purpose as do dynamic parameter markers, and
    executing a stored procedure is equivalent to executing a prepared
    statement. [lambda vs. named procedure]
** error handling
   All Client-Library routines return success or failure
   indications. It is highly recommended that applications check these
   return codes.
** sequence
   At the context level, an application sets up its environment:
   allocating one or more context structures, setting CS-Library
   properties for the contexts, initializing Client-Library, and
   setting Client-Library properties for the contexts.

   At the connection level, an application connects to a server:
   allocating one or more connection structures, setting properties
   for the connections, opening the connections, and setting any
   server options for the connections. An application can allocate a
   connection structure only after a context structure has been
   allocated.

   At the command level, an application allocates one or more command
   structures, sends commands, and processes results. An application
   can allocate a command structure only after a connection structure
   has been allocated.
** messages
** macros
   Open Client provides the following macros to help an application
   decode a Client-Library or CS-Library message number and break it
   into its four parts so that each component can be displayed
   separately:
   - CS_LAYER(msg_number) - identifies the layer reporting the error.
   - CS_ORIGIN(msg_number) - indicates where the error manifested
     itself.
   - CS_SEVERITY(msg_number) - indicates the severity of the error.
   - CS_NUMBER(msg_number) - identifies the actual layer-specific error
     number being reported.
** parameters
*** null vs. unused
    Pass NULL and unused pointer parameters as NULL.

    If the parameter has a NULL value, the length variable associated
    with the parameter, if any, must be 0 or CS_UNUSED.

    If the parameter is unused, the length variable associated with
    the parameter, if any, must be CS_UNUSED.

    Pass non-pointer unused parameters as CS_UNUSED.
*** strings
    Most string parameters are associated with a parameter that indicates
    the length of the string.

    When passing a null-terminated string, an application can pass the
    length parameter as CS_NULLTERM.

    When passing a string that is not null-terminated, an application must
    set the associated length parameter to the length, in bytes, of the
    string.

    If a string parameter is NULL the associated length parameter must be
    0 or CS_UNUSED.
*** item numbers
    An application can call ct_res_info with type as CS_NUMDATA to get
    the number of items in the current result set.
** properties
   Login properties are used when logging into a server. Login
   properties include CS_USERNAME, CS_PASSWORD, and CS_PACKETSIZE.

   An application calls ct_config, ct_con_props, and ct_cmd_props to
   set and retrieve Client-Library properties at the context,
   connection, and command structure levels, respectively. An
   application calls cs_config to set and retrieve CS-Library context
   properties.
** results
- Regular row results
- Cursor row results
- Parameter results
- Stored procedure return status results
- Compute row results
- Message results
- Describe results
- Format results

An application processes results by calling ct_results, which
indicates
the type of result available by setting *result_type.

ct_results sets *result_type to CS_CMD_DONE to indicate that the
results of
a “logical command” have been completely processed. A logical
command is generally considered to be any Open Client command
defined via ct_command, ct_dynamic, or ct_cursor.

Some commands, for example a language command containing a
Transact-SQL update statement, do not generate results. ct_results
sets
*result_type to CS_CMD_SUCCEED or CS_CMD_FAIL to indicate the status
of a command that does not return results.

*** processing

*** value
    When processing a result set, there are three ways for an
    application to retrieve a result item’s value:
    - It can call ct_bind to associate a result item with a program
      variable. When the program calls ct_fetch to fetch a result row,
      the item’s value is automatically copied into the associated
      program variable. Most applications will use this method for all
      result items except large text or image values.
    - It can call ct_get_data to retrieve a result item’s value in
      chunks. After calling ct_fetch to fetch the row, the application
      calls ct_get_data in a loop. Each ct_get_data call retrieves a
      chunk of the result item’s value. Most application will use
      ct_get_data only to retrieve large text or image values.
    - It can call ct_dyndesc to retrieve result item descriptions and
      values. An application calls ct_dyndesc once for each result
      item, after calling ct_fetch to fetch the row. Typical
      applications will not use ct_dyndesc, which is intended for
      precompiler support.
** types
* ctlib guide
** applications
*** interpreter
    - ct_command(CS_LANG_CMD) to define a language command and its
      text
    - ct_send to send it to the server
    - ct_results to read the results
    - ct_res_info and ct_describe to find out column formats
    - ct_bind and ct_fetch to retrieve rows

*** interactive
    [we might be doing this with the library; but also the first,
    too.]
    - Prepare the statement, by sending a ct_dynamic(CS_PREPARE)
      command and handling the results
    - Query for parameter formats, by sending a
      ct_dynamic(CS_DESCRIBE_INPUT) command and handling the

** example
   1. Set up the Client-Library programming environment:
      1.  Use cs_ctx_alloc to allocate a context structure.
      2.  Use cs_config to set any CS-Library properties for the
          context.
      3.  Use ct_init to initialize Client-Library.
      4.  Use ct_config to set Client-Library properties for the
          context.
   2. Define error handling. Most applications use callback routines to
      handle errors:
      1.  Use cs_config(CS_MESSAGE_CB) to install a CS-Library error
          callback.
      2.  Use ct_callback to install a client message callback.
      3.  Use ct_callback to install a server message callback.
   3. Connect to a server:
      1. Use ct_con_alloc to allocate a connection structure.
      2.  Use ct_con_props to set any properties in the connection
          structure
      3.  Use ct_connect to open a connection to a server.
      4.  Use ct_options to set any server options for this
          connection.
   4. Send a language command to the server:
      1.  Use ct_cmd_alloc to allocate a command structure.
      2.  Use ct_command to initiate a language command.
      3.  Use ct_send to send the command.
   5. Process the results of the command:
      1.  Use ct_results to set up results for processing (called in a
          loop).
      2.  Use ct_res_info to get information about a result set.
      3.  Use ct_describe to get information about a result item.
      4.  Use ct_bind to bind a result item to program data space.
      5.  Use ct_fetch to fetch result rows (called in a loop).
   6. Finish:
      1.  Use ct_cmd_drop to deallocate the command structure.
      2.  Use ct_close to close the connection with the server.
      3.  Use ct_exit to exit Client-Library.
      4.  Use cs_ctx_drop to deallocate the context structure.
** initializing client library
*** external configuration
    As an alternative to setting properties with hard-coded ct_config
    calls, Client- Library allows external configuration of property
    values for applications that have been configured to use this
    feature.
** connect
   For a complete list of connection properties, see the ct_con_props
   reference page in the Open Client Client-Library/C Reference
   Manual.
** send commands
** process the results of a command
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   while ct_results returns CS_SUCCEED
            switch on result_type
                case row results
                    for each column:
                        ct_bind
                    end for
                    while ct_fetch is returning rows
                        process each row
                    end while
                    check ct_fetch’s final return code
                end case row results
                case command done ....
                case command failed ....
                case other result type....
                ... raise an error ...
            end switch
   end while
   check ct_results’ final return code   
   #+END_EXAMPLE
** command rules
   Within a connection, the results of a command must be completely
   processed before another command can be sent. The exception to this
   rule is a ct_cursor (CS_CURSOR_OPEN) command, which generates a
   cursor result set.
** types
   Client-Library supports a wide range of datatypes, which are shared
   with CS-Library and Server-Library. In most cases, they correspond
   directly to Adaptive Server datatypes. [most cases?]

   cstypes.h

   There are two reasons why you should use Open Client/Server
   datatypes in your application rather than the native C datatypes:
   heterogeneous architecture, and portability of application code.

   For this reason, always use the correct CS_TYPEDEF to declare any
   variable that holds data to be sent to the server or read from the
   results of a server command.
*** type constants
    Type constants are symbolic values that identify the datatype of a
    program variable. Many CS-Library, Client-Library, and
    Server-Library routines take the address of a program variable as
    a CS_VOID * parameter. Type constants are required to identify the
    datatype when passing CS_VOID * parameters. Typically, a type
    constant is passed to a routine as the datatype field of a
    CS_DATAFMT structure.
** errors and messages
*** CS_EXTRA_INF
    The CS_EXTRA_INF property determines whether or not Client-Library
    returns certain kinds of informational messages, such as the
    number of rows affected by a command.
*** sequencing long messages
    Message callback routines and ct_diag return Client-Library and
    server messages in CS_CLIENTMSG and CS_SERVERMSG structures. In
    the CS_CLIENTMSG structure, the message text is stored in the
    msgstring field. In the CS_SERVERMSG structure, the message text
    is stored in the text field. Both msgstring and text are
    CS_MAX_MSG bytes long.

    If a message longer than CS_MAX_MSG - 1 bytes is generated,
    Client- Library’s default behavior is to truncate the
    message. However, an application can use the CS_NO_TRUNCATE
    property to instruct Client-Library to “sequence” long messages
    instead of truncating them.
*** extended error data
    On receiving this message, the application must identify the
    problem column or columns to the end user so that the user can
    readily correct them. This information is also available in the
    text of the duplicate key message, but an application must parse
    the text to extract the column names.

    For information about how to identify and process extended error
    data, see the “Error and Message Handling” topics page in the Open
    Client Client- Library/C Reference Manual.
** command types
   The following types of commands can take parameters:
   - A language command, when the command text contains variables
   - An RPC command, when the stored procedure takes parameters
   - A cursor-declare command, when the body of the cursor contains host
     language parameters
   - A cursor-open command, when the body of the cursor contains host
     language parameters
   - A message command
   - A dynamic SQL execute command
   
   An application calls ct_param or ct_setparam once for each
   parameter that a command requires. These routines perform the same
   function, except that ct_param copies a parameter value, while
   ct_setparam copies the address of a variable that contains the
   value. If ct_setparam is used, Client-Library reads the parameter
   value when the command is sent.
*** processing
    Each time a command is sent, the application must process or
    cancel the results. A typical application calls ct_results until
    it returns a value other than CS_SUCCEED.
*** language commands
    Language commands for Adaptive Server must be written in
    Transact-SQL. [that's not MSSQL, though.]

    Your application initiates a language command by calling
    ct_command with type as CS_LANG_CMD and *buffer as the language
    text.

    Language commands can take parameters. For Adaptive Server client
    applications, parameter placement is indicated by undeclared
    variables in the command text. For example, a language command
    such as the one below takes a parameter whose value is substituted
    for “@state_name”: select au_lname, city from pubs2..authors \
    where state = @state_name" [again, not MSSQL.]
*** cursors
    Use Client-Library cursors when you want to process two or more
    commands at the same time while using only one server
    connection. [only use case?]
** results-handling
*** types
    - Regular row results – rows returned when the server processes a
        select statement.
    - Cursor row results – rows returned when the server processes a
        ct_cursor Client-Library cursor-open command.
    - Parameter results – fetchable data that can represent:
        - Output values for an Adaptive Server stored procedure’s
            return parameters
        - Output values for an Open Server registered procedure’s
            return parameters
   - A new timestamp value for an updated text/image column (seen only
       when processing the results of a ct_command send-data command)
   - A new timestamp value for a row that was updated with a language
       command containing a browse-mode update statement
   - Stored procedure return status results – the return value from an
     Adaptive Server stored procedure or Open Server registered
     procedure.
   - Compute row results –intermediate rows returned when the server
     processes a select statement with a compute by clause.
   - Message results – a message ID returned by an Open Server
     application’s message command handler while processing the
     results of a message command.
   - Describe results – informational results that describe the format
     of a prepared dynamic SQL statement’s input parameters or result
     columns.
   - Format results – informational results used by Open Server
     gateway applications to retrieve regular row and compute row
     formats before the actual data arrives.

   A single command can generate more than one type of result. For
   example, a language command that executes a stored procedure can
   generate multiple regular row and compute row result sets, a
   parameter result set, and a return status result set. For this
   reason, it is important that you code applications to handle all
   types of results that a server can generate.

*** result_type as command status
   - CS_CMD_DONE – indicates that the results of a logical command
     have been completely processed. See “Logical commands” on page
     101 for an explanation of this term.
   - CS_CMD_SUCCEED – indicates the success of a command that returns
     no data, such as a Transact-SQL insert or delete command.
   - CS_CMD_FAIL – indicates that, due to error, the server failed to
     execute a server command. For example, the text of a language
     command might contain a syntax error or refer to a nonexistent
     object.

     Because a Client-Library command can execute multiple server
     commands, an application must either:
     - Continue to call ct_results to process results generated by any
          other server commands contained in the original
          Client-Library command, or
     - Call ct_cancel(CS_CANCEL_ALL) to cancel the Client-Library
       command and discard its results.

   Logical commands and Client-Library commands are not equivalent. A
   Client- Library command can execute multiple logical commands on
   the server, for example, a stored procedure can execute multiple
   select statements that return data, and each such statement
   represents one logical command. A logical command can generate one
   or more result sets; for example, a select statement can return
   multiple regular-row and compute results sets. [and that, mein
   freunds: why we don't do proprietary software.]

*** ct_results final return code
   - CS_END_RESULT – indicates a normal loop exit.
   - CS_CANCELED – indicates that results were canceled:
     ct_cancel(CS_CANCEL_ALL) or ct_cancel(CS_CANCEL_ATTN) was called
     while processing results.
   - CS_FAIL – indicates a serious client-side or network error, such as
     a communication failure or a memory shortage.

** dynamic commands
*** prepare and execute
1. Prepare the dynamic SQL statement.
  -    ct_dynamic(CS_PREPARE)
  -    ct_send
  -    ct_results, in a loop
2. (Optional) Get a description of the parameters required to execute
   the prepared statement.
  -    ct_dynamic(CS_DESCRIBE_INPUT)
  -    ct_send
  -    ct_results, in a loop
  ct_results returns with a result_type of CS_DESCRIBE_RESULT to
  indicate that the parameter descriptions are available.
3. (Optional) Get a description of the result columns returned by the
   prepared statement.
  -    ct_dynamic(CS_DESCRIBE_OUTPUT)
  -    ct_send
  -    ct_results, in a loop
  ct_results returns with a result_type of CS_DESCRIBE_RESULT to
  indicate that the description is available.
4. Execute the prepared statement or declare and open a cursor on the
   prepared statement.  To execute the prepared statement (without a
   cursor):
  -    ct_dynamic(CS_EXECUTE).
  -    If necessary, define parameter values with ct_param,
  ct_setparam,
       ct_dyndesc, or ct_dynsqlda.
  -    ct_send.
  -    ct_results, in a loop. Fetchable results may require
  processing.
  For a description of how to execute a prepared statement with a
  cursor, see
  “Using Client-Library cursors” on page 109.
5. Deallocate the prepared statement.  If a cursor is declared on the
   statement, first close and deallocate the cursor:
  -    ct_cursor(CS_CURSOR_CLOSE, CS_DEALLOC) or, if the cursor is
       not open, ct_cursor(CS_CURSOR_DEALLOC)
  ct_send
  -    ct_results, in a loop
  -    Initiate and send a command to deallocate the prepared
  statement:
  -    ct_dynamic(CS_DEALLOC)
  -    ct_send
  -    ct_results, in a loop
  The deallocate command returns no fetchable results.

** foreign-safe-lambda
  [syntax] (foreign-safe-lambda RETURNTYPE NAME ARGTYPE ...) 

  This is similar to foreign-lambda, but also allows the called function
  to call Scheme functions and allocate Scheme data-objects. See
  Callbacks.
